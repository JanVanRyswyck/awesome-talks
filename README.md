#Awesome talks

There are a lot of screencasts, recordings of user group gatherings and conference talks available online. I try to commit myself watching at least two new talks every week, and I've been doing this for quite some time now. I created this list of online talks that I really enjoyed watching. I'll also be updating this list whenever I've watched another *awesome* talk that is worthy enough. Suggestions are always appreciated through a pull request. So without further ado ..

(In no particular order)
